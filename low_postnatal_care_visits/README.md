# Low Postnatal Care Visits After Delivery

## Problem Overview

Many Kenyan mothers do not return for postnatal checkups after leaving public health facilities, which increases the risk of preventable complications for both mothers and newborns.

This project simulates a real‑world data analysis scenario focused on understanding and improving postnatal care (PNC) attendance within 6 weeks of delivery.

## Objective

**Key question**

> Which mothers are least likely to attend recommended postnatal visits within 6 weeks of delivery, and what factors predict low attendance?

This analysis aims to identify high‑risk groups so that targeted interventions can be designed.

## Success Metric

The primary success metric for this project is:

> Increase the proportion of mothers with at least one postnatal visit within 6 weeks of delivery.

In the portfolio context, this translates to:

- Measuring current PNC 6‑week attendance rates.  
- Quantifying how attendance varies across subgroups (age, county, residence type, PROMPTS engagement, and others).  
- Using insights to propose evidence‑based actions that could raise the overall PNC 6‑week attendance rate.

## What This Project Demonstrates

This project is designed to showcase an end‑to‑end data analytics workflow:

- Problem framing and defining a clear analytic question.  
- Working with synthetic but realistic health data (mothers, facilities, and digital engagement).  
- Exploring which factors predict PNC attendance within 6 weeks.  
- Communicating insights that could inform program and policy decisions in a Kenyan maternal health context.
